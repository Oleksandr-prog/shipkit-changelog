# Shipkit Changelog Gradle plugin

Minimalistic Gradle plugin that generates changelog based on commit history and GitHub pull requests/issues. 
Optionally, the changelog content can be posted to GitHub Releases.
This plugin is very small (<1kloc) and has a single dependency "com.eclipsesource.minimal-json:minimal-json:0.9.5".
The dependency is very small (30kb), stable (no changes since 2017), and brings zero transitive dependencies.

Example ([more examples](https://github.com/shipkit/shipkit-changelog/releases)):

----
#### 0.0.7
 - 2020-07-15 - [1 commit(s)](https://github.com/shipkit/shipkit-changelog/compare/v0.0.6...v0.0.7) by Szczepan Faber
 - Fixed broken links [(#12)](https://github.com/shipkit/shipkit-changelog/pull/12)
----

## Basic usage

```
plugins {  
    id 'org.shipkit.shipkit-changelog'
}

tasks.named("generateChangelog") {
    previousRevision = "v0.0.1"
    readOnlyToken = "a0a4c0f41c200f7c653323014d6a72a127764e17"
    repository = "shipkit/shipkit-changelog"
}

```

## Realistic example

Realistic example, also uses a sibling plugin [shipkit-auto-version](https://github.com/shipkit/shipkit-auto-version) plugin
(source: [gradle/release.gradle](https://github.com/shipkit/shipkit-changelog/blob/master/gradle/release.gradle))

```
    plugins {
        id 'org.shipkit.shipkit-changelog'
        id 'org.shipkit.shipkit-gh-release'
        id 'org.shipkit.shipkit-auto-version'
    }

    tasks.named("generateChangelog") {
        previousRevision = "v" + project.ext.'shipkit-auto-version.previous-version'
        readOnlyToken = "a0a4c0f41c200f7c653323014d6a72a127764e17"
        repository = "shipkit/shipkit-changelog"
    }
    
    tasks.named("githubRelease") {
        dependsOn tasks.named("generateChangelog")
        repository = "shipkit/shipkit-changelog"
        changelog = tasks.named("generateChangelog").get().outputFile                
        writeToken = System.getenv("GH_WRITE_TOKEN")
    }
```

## Configuration reference

### GitHub access tokens

The standard way to enable automated tasks read/write to GitHub are [personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token).
When creating the tokens, please select the following token **scopes** ([more info on scopes](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps)):

- readOnlyToken - should have **no scope**, this way it only provides read-only access to **public** repositories
(it **does not** provide read-only access to private repositories).
- writeToken - needs 'repo/public_repo' scope to post releases via GH REST API.

### Fetch depth on CI

CI systems are often configured by default to perform Git fetch with minimum amount of commits.
However, our changelog plugin needs commits in order to generate the release notes.
When using GH actions, please configure your checkout action to fetch the entire history.
Based on our tests in Mockito project, the checkout of the *entire* Mockito history (dating 2008)
has negligible performance implication (adds ~2 secs to the checkout).

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2   # docs: https://github.com/actions/checkout
  with:
    fetch-depth: '0' # will fetch the entire history
```

## Other plugins/tools

There are other Gradle plugins or tools that provide similar functionality:

1. [github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator)
is a popular Ruby Gem (6K stars on GitHub) that generates changelog based on commits/pull requests
but does not publish GitHub releases ([#56](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator/issues/56)).
Our plugin is a pure Gradle solution and it can publish a GitHub release.

2. GitHub Action [Release Drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter)
drafts the next release notes as pull requests are merged.
This is a good option when the team wants to release on demand. 
Our plugin is great for fully automated releases on every merged pull request.

3. Gradle Plugin [git-changelog-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/tomasbjerre/git-changelog-gradle-plugin)
seems like a nice plugin, maintained but not very popular (<50 stars on GitHub) and pulls in a lot of other dependencies
([#21](https://github.com/tomasbjerre/git-changelog-gradle-plugin/issues/21)).
Our plugin is simpler, smaller and brings only one dependency (that is very small, simple and has no transitive dependencies).

4. Semantic Release [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
is a npm module for fully automated "semantic" releases, with changelog generation.  
It has impressive 10K stars on GitHub.
Our plugin is less opinionated, smaller, simpler and a pure Gradle solution.

Pick the best tool that work for you and start automating releases and changelog generation!

## Design
     
### Changelog generation

1. Collect commits between 2 revisions
2. Find ticket IDs based on '#' prefix in commit messages (e.g. looking for #1, #50, etc.)
3. Use GitHub REST API to collect ticket information (issue or pull request) from GitHub
4. Create markdown file using the PR/issue titles 

### Posting GitHub releases

Uses GitHub REST API to post releases.
